# Pacific Warehouse
Project 1

##Synopsis

Pacific Warehouse is a choose your own adventure, point and click scavenger hunt game.

The game starts when the player sees someone walk into an abandoned warehouse. You have the option to enter through the front or back door. The game progresses from there, and you can guide yourself through the building in multiple ways and pick up objects along the way.

##Functionality

The technologies used include Javascript as well as JQuery libraries for the slides and story progression.

##Expansion

I plan on expanding the game further with story and creating interactive and varying endings depending on the paths players take.

There will be items scattered throughout the building that you can pick up and drag into an inventory bar.

I'm also working on a draggable/droppable option for the items so you can snap them to your inventory belt.


##Future Fixes

There may be some issues if the game is viewed on different browsers with the interactive background API, so this is also something I need to find a solution for.
