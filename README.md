# Pacific Warehouse
Project 1

##Synopsis

The game starts when the player sees someone walk into an abandoned warehouse. You have the option to enter through the front or back door. The game progresses from there, and you can guide yourself through the building in multiple ways and pick up objects along the way.

##Functionality

The various options are built with jQuery and I wrote code that enables you to "win" if you gather three items in your inventory.

There may be some issues if the game is viewed on different browsers with the interactive background API, so this is also something I need to find a solution for.

##Currently working on

I'm working on a draggable/droppable option for the items so you can snap them to your inventory belt.

##Expansion

I plan on expanding the game further with story and creating interactive and varying endings depending on the paths players take.
